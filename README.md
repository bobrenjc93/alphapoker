# AlphaPoker

AlphaPoker is an AlphaGo-inspired poker research repo. The first milestone is
deliberately small and verifiable: solve Kuhn poker with self-play CFR, measure
exploitability, and optionally distill the tabular policy into a neural
policy/value model. Kuhn is not full poker, but it exercises the core issue that
Go does not have: hidden information.

This follows the useful shape of `ericjang/autogo`: rules, search/self-play,
model code, experiment scripts, and tests live in the repo so agents can iterate
on experiments without changing the foundations each time.

## Quickstart

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest
uv run python -m alphapoker.train --iterations 50000 --out experiments/kuhn_cfr_baseline
```

The training command writes:

- `strategy.json`: average CFR strategy and exploitability report.
- `metrics.json`: compact scalar metrics for experiment tracking.

To also train the small policy/value network from the CFR strategy:

```bash
uv run --extra train python -m alphapoker.train \
  --iterations 50000 \
  --network-epochs 500 \
  --out experiments/kuhn_cfr_baseline
```

## Current Milestone

- Exact Kuhn poker environment with legal actions and zero-sum payoffs.
- Tabular CFR/CFR+ self-play trainer.
- Exact best-response exploitability by enumerating deterministic policies.
- Optional PyTorch policy/value model for distillation from the CFR average
  strategy.
- Limit Leduc poker rules for the next imperfect-information benchmark.
- Tabular Leduc CFR trainer with exact expected-value evaluation.

## Research Roadmap

1. Keep Kuhn as the fast correctness harness.
2. Add exact or sampled Leduc best-response evaluation.
3. Move from full-tree Leduc CFR to external-sampling MCCFR and neural regret/policy
   approximation.
4. Add distributed self-play and GPU jobs through `gpu-dev submit`.
5. Only treat "superhuman" as satisfied for a specific poker variant after
   exploitability and match-play evaluation against strong baselines support it.
